# Robust-Behavioral-Cloning-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
This is my project of behavioral cloning using applied deep learning.  It is simulated in the Udacity simulator. A Convolutional Neural Network model is trained which extracts relevant features from images taken at each instance. Each image has steering data as a label which helps in steering commands to maneuver throughout the track.
