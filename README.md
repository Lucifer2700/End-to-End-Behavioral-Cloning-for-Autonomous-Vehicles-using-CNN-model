# Robust-Behavioral-Cloning-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
In this project I contributed towards behavioral cloning using applied deep learning. It is simulated in the open source Udacity simulator. A Convolutional Neural Network model is trained which extracts relevant features from images taken at each instance during training mode. Each image has steering data as a label which helps in steering commands to maneuver throughout the track. The throttle controller is a Bang-Bang control implementaton to reduce compulational latencies.
# Simulation Environment
The environment chosen is a courtesy of Udacity developed in Unity and can be found here [open source simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).
"Version 2" supports two tracks, `Mountaineous` and `Lake` track for collecting training data and testing of deep learning model.
